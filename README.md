# Student project: additions to the SSA for multiscale models of infectious diseases

Student project for the course Mathematical Modelling and Simulation, fall semester 2025-2025, University of Trento. In this project, we analyze the results from the paper:

Accurate stochastic simulation algorithm for multiscale models of infectious diseases
by Yuan Yin, Jennifer A. Flegg, Mark B. Flegg

https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.05058

The original repository can be accessed through https://github.com/YuanYIN99/Accurate-stochastic-simulation-algorithm-for-multiscale-models-of-infectious-diseases. 

The sole differences within this repository are the added code to reproduce Figure 6 of the manuscript, for which the code can be found in the 'Plot_accuracy.m' file, the First Reaction Method simulations in the folder 'SI model simulations' and the small addition of code in the 'WH-figure.m' file to reproduce figure 2(b), so we stress that everything else is not our work.
